# Joalor64 Engine: PFNF Version
* My custom version of Project FNF but with some changes lol.
* [Psych Engine Version](github.com/Joalor64GH/Joalor64-Engine)

# Features
* Cool scripts that do things.
* Health Counter, Space to V-pose, Secret Keys, and Rank Screen!
* After you complete a song, your rank is displayed!
* After that, just press space to go back to the menu.
* Still tryna figure out how to make the freeplay and pause menu move in a disc-like motion similar to dnb lol.
* Hope you enjoy!
